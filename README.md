## Development

Prefer working locally? You need Node.js and npm — [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

```sh
git clone <this-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Images from the old site

The About, Products and InfoJoy pages use files from `https://marketjoy.com/wp-content/...`. `npm run dev` / `npm run build`
download any that are missing into `public/` (see `scripts/fetch-industry-images.mjs`; run it by hand with
`npm run images:industries`). Until a file is downloaded the page loads it straight from marketjoy.com, and if that fails
too it shows a neutral placeholder instead of a broken image.
